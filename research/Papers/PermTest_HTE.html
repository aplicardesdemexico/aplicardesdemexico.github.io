<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>This paper studies a classical problem in statistics: testing goodness of fit in the presence of a nuisance parameter. The main contribution of this paper is a novel permutation test for this testing problem that is asymptotically valid under fairly weak assumptions, while still providing an exact error control in finite samples under more restrictive conditions. In addition, the permutation test presented here is shown to have finite- and large-sample properties comparable to those existing in the literature.</p>

<p>The main result relies on the martingale transformation of the empirical process introduced by <a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/1126027">Khmaladze (1981)</a>. This procedure debugs the empirical process from the effect of the nuisance parameter by decomposing the empirical process into two parts - a martingale that has a standard Brownian motion asymptotic behavior, and a second part that vanishes as the sample size  grows  large.</p>

<p>A noteworthy application of this testing problem is the one of testing for heterogeneous treatment effect in a randomized experiment. In this context, the null hypothesis implies that the <em>distribution</em> of the treatment and control groups are a constant shift apart. Moreover,  the  proposed  method  can be  extended  to  testing  the  joint  null  hypothesis  that  treatment  effects  are  constant  within individual  subgroups,  while  allowing  for  varying average treatment  effects  across  subgroups. As a result, this test is able to detect treatment effect heterogeneity within individual subgroups even if the average treatment effects are identical across subgroups.</p>

<p>We apply our test to investigate the gift exchange hypothesis in the context of two field experiments from <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-0262.2006.00707.x">Gneezy and List (2006)</a>. Our test rejects the null in favor of the heterogeneity in the treatment effect, where solely looking at the average treatment effect does not provide evidence in favor of the gift exchange hypothesis.</p>
