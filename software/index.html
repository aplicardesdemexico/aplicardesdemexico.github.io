				<p><em><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RATest/index.html">RATest</a></em>: A collection of permutation tests (Joint with <em><a href="https://ignaciomsarmiento.github.io/">Ignacio Sarmiento Barbieri</a></em>)</p>

				<p><strong>Description:</strong> A collection of randomization tests, data sets and examples. This version considers two main testing problems. The first one concerns with the general testing problem of comparisons of parameters between 2 or more populations, e.g. comparison of means, medians or variances, as well as parameters that depend on the joint
				distribution of populations as in <em><a href="https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aos/1366138199">Chung and Romano (2013)</a></em>. Second, the description and implementation of a permutation test for testing the continuity assumption of the baseline covariates in the sharp regression discontinuity design (RDD) as in <em><a href="https://academic.oup.com/restud/article/85/3/1577/4583623">Canay and Kamat (2018)</a></em>.</p>
